What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

(at initialization no files are added yet to the repository)
all the files in the repository will get monitored by git on
the future. You do it in order to keep track of further changes 
in your files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

temporary area, you can pick a bundle of files to make one commit or you can pick just one file to commit, it is like
a prepping area before sending them in the repository, so you what to do next and how your files are linked together

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

you can use git diff --staged to see how the last commit and the staging area differ

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

when you want to create different versions of the program,
add and test out some features it would be a good idea to branch. Branches do not interfere with the main source code unless they are merged so they can develop independently.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

get a clear idea of the project structure, where you are , what you want to do and if you want to return to a previous state or create a new one
