When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- in case you don't have access to your local machine, such that you can still work 
- to allow other people check your work and possibly make contributions

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

better user control over the time when to sync the 2 processes
maybe you tried to create a new feature and added it to the repo on GitHub,
but than you don't wanted anymore, with automatic control that feature would 
have been added(or some commits on that feature development) on the local repo,
an annoying situation so to say.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork = type of cloning, pertaining to GitHub, clones the repository history from a place into your account on GitHub
clones = can be used to copy a repository's history on the local machine, or from
a url to the local machine
branches = separates in order to add a new feature, solve bugs, create a different version from the original etc.
